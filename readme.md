# Laramie Documentation

## Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**. Well-written, thorough documentation is just as
important as good code. I'd only ask that you submit updates to the appropriate
branch. For example, if you are submitting documetation for `v0.1` submit that
pull request to branch `v0.1`.

A formatted version of this documentation can be found at
(laramie.io/docs)[https://laramie.io/docs].
